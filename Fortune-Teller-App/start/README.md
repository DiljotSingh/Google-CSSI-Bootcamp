To launch the app, navigate to the where the project directory is in your terminal (when you type dir or ls, it should display app.yaml, main.py, main.pyc, etc) and then type the command "dev_appserver.py app.yaml" to launch the app in your local host. Go to localhost:8080/ in a new tab in your browser and the app should be working.
